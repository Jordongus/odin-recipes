    <h2>About This Dish</h2>
    <p>
        Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro is an 
        Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with 
        butter and Parmesan cheese. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the 
        liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta. In this 
        recipe we will be toping it off with grilled chicken for an extra kick of flavor.

    <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <Li><strong>Prepare the chicken.</strong> 
            Use a sharp knife to slice each chicken breast in half horizontally, 
            to create a thin cutlet. Start at the thick edge of the chicken breast. 
            See photos. You should end up with 4 thin pieces of chicken that are the 
            same shape as a chicken breast, just thinner.
        </Li><br>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, combine 1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 
            and 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika. Pat the chicken with paper towels on 
            both sides until it is very dry. Sprinkle the spice mixture all over 
            the chicken on both sides, and rub in.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Heat a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R3CSHFD/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B09R3CSHFD&pd_rd_w=rxDzd&pf_rd_p=df921cda-5343-4253-9b4b-22d7387ad3d4&pd_rd_wg=vmGRP&pf_rd_r=M02MBJTCXSRCFNGNT4ZG&pd_rd_r=8f7176a7-a08d-48b0-b150-e6586be500c4&s=kitchen" >12-inch saute pan</a> 
            over medium high heat for at least 3 minutes. When 
            it is hot, add 2 tablespoons oil. Swirl to coat. 
            The oil should shimmer right away.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Carefully place the chicken in the pan. Once it touches the pan you can’t 
            move it, so arrange accordingly. Do not crowd the chicken. If your pan isn’t 
            big enough, do it in batches. Do not touch, poke, or move the chicken at 
            all. It needs to stay put to get a nice sear.
        </li><br>
        <Li>
            Once all the chicken is in the pan, lower the heat to medium. 
            Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes. If you try to flip the chicken 
            and it sticks to the pan, it’s not ready to turn.
        </Li><br>
        <li>Use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Stainless-Kitchen-Non-Slip-12-Inch/dp/B07W13QV9Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=tongs&qid=1653023252&sr=8-1-spons&th=1" >tongs</a>
             to flip each piece of chicken, swirling the pan
             as necessary to coat with oil. Immediately add 1 tablespoon butter 
             to the pan and swirl the pan as it melts. (The butter helps the 
             chicken to brown, and brings flavor.) Cook the chicken on the 
             second side for about 2 minutes, until the other side is a deep 
             golden brown and a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F. 
             Remove the chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm. Leave all 
             juices in the pan. (Turn the heat off if you’re not ready to 
             make the sauce yet)
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine.</strong> Fill a 3 quart pot with water. Add 1 
            tablespoon kosher salt and bring to a boil over high heat. When it is 
            at a rolling boil, add 12 ounces of fettuccine. Stir occasionally so 
            the noodles don’t stick to each other. Cook for about 10 minutes, 
            until the noodles are al dente (don’t over cook!) Drain the noodles, 
            but be sure to save about a cup of the pasta water. Set it aside in 
            a small bowl. Then add a drizzle of olive oil to the noodles and 
            stir so that they don’t stick to each other. Set aside.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the alfredo sauce.</strong> In the same pan that you cooked the chicken 
            in, add 3/4 cup butter (1 and 1/2 sticks) over medium heat. Let 
            it melt and bubble a bit (don’t let it brown), then add 5 cloves of 
            smashed and minced garlic. Saute the garlic for 1 minute until 
            fragrant.
        </li><br>
        <Li>
            Slowly add 2 cups of cream while stirring. Take your time. Add 1 and 
            1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/8 teaspoon 
            cayenne pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg.
        </Li><br>
        <li>
            Let the cream mixture cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes until 
            you see gentle bubbles on the side of the pan. Do not bring to a full 
            boil; your sauce will break (meaning it will look curdled instead of 
            smooth). Lower the heat to medium low.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Finely shred 1 and 1/2 cups parmesan cheese using the 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011B8M2GO/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?pd_rd_i=B011B8M2GO&pd_rd_w=4AXkQ&pf_rd_p=33c4e3fc-b90b-44ce-8b60-9caf530f918e&pd_rd_wg=FGV2m&pf_rd_r=ZYJQ6HZJW06576DB5K6X&pd_rd_r=f56ab236-d4e0-4465-9b8d-b2482a902bf6&s=kitchen&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzUUcwQVlUVVNDVzhXJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDQ3MjkwMUVWNFlCWTFSNk41OSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTExMjE4MkVPSTZTQzZMT1paTiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1" >finest grater</a>. 
            I do not recommend using pre shredded parmesan 
            (and definitely not the powdered stuff). Pre-grated cheese will not 
            melt as well, and your sauce will be clumpy.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Add the cheese to the sauce just a few tablespoons at a time. Sprinkle 
            some in and stir for a bit to help it melt, then add a bit more cheese, 
            stir, etc. This will help the cheese to melt more thoroughly, making a 
            smooth sauce.
        </li><br>
        <Li>
            Once all the cheese is added in, taste the sauce and adjust seasonings as 
            you like.
        </Li><br>
        <li>
            Add the noodles in batches so that it all gets coated well in sauce. 
            Add in about 1/3, stir to coat, the next 1/3, and so on.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the chicken into strips against 
            the grain. You can either plate the pasta and arrange the chicken on 
            top to serve, or add the chicken to the pasta in the pan and stir it 
            all together.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            If you have a wait a few minutes before serving, keep the heat on low 
            and cover. The sauce will continue to thicken as it sits, so to loosen 
            it just before serving, add the reserved pasta water a couple 
            tablespoons at a time, stirring well.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Top each serving with extra parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley!
